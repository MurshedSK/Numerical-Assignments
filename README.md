## 📖 Overview

This repository contains my solutions and code implementations for various assignments completed during the **Numerical Methods** course. The projects explore fundamental algorithms used in computational physics to solve mathematical problems that cannot be solved analytically.

The primary focus is on implementing algorithms from scratch to understand the underlying mathematics of stability, convergence, and error analysis.

## 📂 Repository Contents

The assignments cover the following key topics in numerical analysis:

| Topic | Description | Algorithms Implemented |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Roots of Equations** | Finding zeroes of non-linear functions. | Bisection, Newton-Raphson, Secant Method |
| **Numerical Integration** | Approximating definite integrals. | Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson's 1/3 & 3/8 Rules, Gaussian Quadrature |
| **Ordinary Differential Equations** | Solving ODEs for physical systems. | Euler's Method, Runge-Kutta (RK2, RK4) |
| **Linear Algebra** | Solving systems of linear equations. | Gaussian Elimination, LU Decomposition, Jacobi Method |
| **Curve Fitting & Interpolation** | Analyzing data sets. | Least Squares Regression, Lagrange Interpolation |

*(Note: The implementations focus on accuracy and computational efficiency.)*

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

* **Language:** Python 3 (and/or Fortran where applicable)
* **Libraries:**
    * `NumPy`: For vectorization and numerical operations.
