        "We consider that instead of fixing the initial conditions (a, b, maximum error), it is better to give the inputs from the terminal. When giving the inputs we enter some absurd values (in our case 'q' instead of '1'). We did it because we think there might be input errors from the users (like '1' is just above 'q' in the QWERTY keyboard and sometimes there might be a typing error.) We also consider the range/interval where the root belong. So if the root is not in the chosen range, then we can again chose the range accordingly. In our case we chose the interval [1,2] and get that the root(viz. 0.6931) is not within the range. These parts are additional in the codes and probably not requied also for the asssignments. We did it because we wanted to extend our thinking of the possibility.\n",
